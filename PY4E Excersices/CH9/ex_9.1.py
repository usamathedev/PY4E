# BOOKS EXCERCISE 1

# Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt

# Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary

# fhand = open("words.txt")
# wordsdict = dict()

# for line in fhand :
#     words = line.split()
#     for word in words :
#         wordsdict[word] = len(word)

# print(wordsdict)
